Fake news is a major concern in our society right now.We believe what we saw and sometimes it leads to catastropic results. 
It has gone hand-in-hand with the rise of the data-driven era – not a coincidence when you consider the sheer volume of data we are generating every second!<br>
Fake news is such a widespread issue that even the world’s leading dictionaries are trying to combat it in their own way. Here are two leading lights in that space taking a stance in recent years<br>
<ul>
     <li> Dictionary.com listed ‘misinformation’ as their Word of the Year in 2018. </li>
     <li> Oxford Dictionary picked ‘post-truth’ as their Word of the Year a few years ago </li>
</ul>

Fake news is a form of news consisting of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional news media (print and broadcast) or online social media.<br>
Fake News is any news that is either factually wrong, misrepresents the facts, and that spreads virally (or maybe to a targeted audience). 
It can be spread both through regular news mediums or on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.<br>
What truly differentiates Fake News from simple hoaxes like “Moon landing was fake”, etc. is the fact that it carefully mimics the “style” and “patterns” that real news usually follows. <br>
That’s what makes it so hard to distinguish for the untrained human eye.<br>
Additionally, it is interesting to note that Fake News has been around for a long, long time (throughout our history, actually).<br><br>

Detecting fake news is not an easy task as sequence of words matters in deciding whether a news is real or fake. <br>
Hence, we will use Recurrent Neural Network or RNN which works by taking into consideration the sequence of words to built a classifier which would help in differentiating news as fake or real.<br>
We will use dataset named as <b>train.csv</b> and <b>test.csv</b> to find fake news. <br>
They are large datasets and hence deep learning would be useful for model building. We have used Keras module which is a high level API.<br>
